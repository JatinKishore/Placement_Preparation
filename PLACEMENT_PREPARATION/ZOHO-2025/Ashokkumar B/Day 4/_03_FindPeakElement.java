/*
LeetCode - 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks,
return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater
than a neighbor that is outside the array.
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
