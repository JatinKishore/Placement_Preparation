**WIPRO DRIVE EXPERIENCE**

If you are waiting for Wipro results:

*"2 months la enaku result vanthuchi"*
*"I attended in November, got my result at the end of January."*

Initial process: MCQ, coding, HR interview — after this, they shortlist you for training.
Then comes some assessments during training.

Even after getting inside, they keep you on the bench for a while. Now there is a **main assessment** — you need to pass this to get a project.

You get **3 attempts**. If you don’t pass, mostly it’s termination.
