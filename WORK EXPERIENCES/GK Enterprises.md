## Automation Engineer Role Details

Actually, for the **Automation Engineer role**, the hiring involves some **networking basics** — something like **basic work on switches**.  
Apart from that, it will be related to **electronics**, such as **OS booting in BCU** and **basic-level configuration**.

- **Mostly, they will assign you to onsite work in the North side** (only in substations).  
- You will **get real experience and recognition only when you are given a site to handle independently**.  
- Until then, you will be considered **similar to an intern**.

They won’t **specify exactly when you will get an independent site**.  
For your **first site**, there will be a **senior assigned with you**, and **only when they decide you’re ready** will you get your own site.  
It’s **not predictable** when you will get that opportunity, as it depends entirely on that senior.

Ultimately, your **career growth and recognition are not in your control** in this role, so **this is not really recommended**.

Instead, **try for a field you like**.  
This is **not a software domain**. If possible, **wait a little and put in effort for the domain you prefer**.
