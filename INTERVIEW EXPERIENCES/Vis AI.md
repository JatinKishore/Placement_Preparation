## I. Interview Experiences

### Experience #1: Pattern Recognition & Systems Focus
* **Initial Screening**: High emphasis on logic puzzles with a complexity twist.
* **Key Puzzle**: 1000 Jars of Wine (1 poisoned). 
    * **Optimal Solution**: Binary representation using 10 prisoners (since $2^{10} = 1024 \ge 1000$).
* **Technical Rounds**: Focused on Resume proficiency (70% bar) and Array manipulation.
* **Core Technical Problems**:
    * **Rabbit Problem**: Population growth tracking.
      * [Click & Solve: Fibonacci Rabbit Sequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/)
    * **Bank Challan**: $y$ dollars and $x$ cents math puzzle.
    * **River Boat Width**: Distance/Speed relative meeting points.
    * **Subarray Logic**: Largest sum of consecutive values.
      * [Click & Solve: Kadane's Algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

### Experience #2: Subjective Analytical Round
* **Format**: 6 complex logical puzzles in a subjective written format.
* **Elimination**: High-stakes round designed to filter 80% of candidates.
* **Key Puzzles**:
    * **Melting Candles**: Thick (6h) vs Thin (3h) candle length ratio.
      * **Solution**: $t = 2.4 \text{ hours}$ (2 hours 24 minutes).
    * **Chocolate Mixture**: Profit loss due to rate mixing.
    * **Code Cracking**: 4-digit deduction from clues (Guess 2468 = zero correct).
      * **Result**: Code is 3079.
