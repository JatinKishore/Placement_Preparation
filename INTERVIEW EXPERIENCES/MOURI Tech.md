1. Screening & Consulting Readiness

    The Communication Bar: Because MOURI Tech works heavily with international clients, your ability to articulate technical solutions is just as important as your code. The Client/Manager Round is often the deciding factor.

    Logical Puzzles: Expect logic-based puzzles during the screening or technical rounds to test your spontaneous problem-solving under pressure.

2. Technical Depth

    SQL Mastery: Many roles at MOURI Tech are data-centric. Be prepared to write complex queries involving Joins, Subqueries, and Indexing.

    Coding Standards: When solving problems like "Reverse a String" or "Find Unique Numbers," interviewers look for clean code and an understanding of Time and Space Complexity.

3. US Client Interaction

    Domain Context: If the role is for a specific sector (like SAP or Cloud), the client may ask how your technical skills solve a specific business problem.

    Cultural Fit: They value a proactive attitude and the ability to work in a collaborative, US-consulting-style environment.
