## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. Aptitude & Logical Screening**
* **The 60-Minute Filter**: Round 1 is strictly non-technical. It focuses on **Quantitative Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, and Analytical Thinking**.
* **Speed & Accuracy**: Since there are no core questions initially, your performance here determines your entry into the specialized department pools.

### **2. Interactive Technical Group Discussion (TGD)**
* **Format**: This is a **Group Interview** rather than a discussion. The HR/Technical Lead asks questions one by one. If you don't know the answer, the question is "passed" to the next person.
* **Bidding for Answers**: If you know the answer, you can raise your hand. Confident and accurate responses here are the primary selection criteria.
* **Core Topics**: Questions are heavily drawn from:
    - **Networking**: OSI Layers, TCP vs UDP, IP addressing, DNS, and DHCP.
    - **Operating Systems**: Process vs Thread, Inter-process Communication (IPC), and Deadlocks.
    - **Electronics**: Microprocessors (8085/8051), Op-Amps, and Digital Logic (Flip-flops, Multiplexing).


### **3. One-on-One Technical & Managerial Rounds**
* **In-Depth Probing**: Those who clear the TGD face 1 or 2 rounds of face-to-face interviews.
* **Live Coding**: Be prepared to write C-snippets on paper, focusing on **Pointers, Memory Allocation, and Bit Manipulation**.
* **Domain Fit**: The panel evaluates if you can adapt to the networking domain, even if your background is purely in ECE or CSE.
