## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. Logic over Aptitude**
* **The "Tricky" Filter**: Traditional quantitative aptitude is not the focus. Instead, candidates face a series of **Tricky Logical Questions** designed to test presence of mind and out-of-the-box thinking.
* **Complexity**: Expect puzzles that require you to break down multi-layered problems before arriving at a solution.

### **2. Advanced SQL Evaluation**
* **Query Scenarios**: Expect roughly 3 specialized SQL questions. These are not basic "Select" queries but "Tricky" scenarios involving complex joins, subqueries, or window functions.
* **Data Integrity**: You may be asked to solve problems related to data constraints or handling null values in specific logic-heavy scenarios.



### **3. Technical Mindset**
* **Optimization**: Since the questions are tricky, the interviewers are likely looking for how efficiently you can write a query rather than just getting the output.
