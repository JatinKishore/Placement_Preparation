# Ideas2IT Interview Experience

The recruitment process at **Ideas2IT** is designed to test a candidate's endurance and logical depth through a unique multi-layered technical assessment. Unlike standard processes, Ideas2IT often uses a "progressive difficulty" model in their coding rounds, requiring both written logic and verbal explanation.

## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. Quantitative & Analytical Filter**
* **Aptitude Round**: A 45-minute assessment consisting of 20 questions. The difficulty is generally **Medium**, covering a mix of Quantitative Aptitude and Logical Reasoning.

### **2. Progressive Coding (The "L1" Layered Round)**
This round is unique because it scales in difficulty as you solve each problem. It is usually a **written paper-based round** where you must explain your logic to the interviewer after each step:
* **Step A**: 1 Easy coding problem + 1 Logical thinking puzzle.
* **Step B**: 1 Medium coding problem + 1 Logical thinking puzzle.
* **Step C**: 1 Hard coding problem + 1 Logical thinking puzzle.
* **Objective**: To see how the candidate adapts to increasing complexity and whether their core logic remains robust.

### **3. Technical Interview**
* **Core Engineering**: Focuses on **OOPS, DBMS**, and the programming language of your choice (Java/Python/C++).
* **Code Walkthrough**: A deep dive into the code written in the previous rounds, discussing time complexity and potential optimizations.
