## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. Online Screening (Coding & English)**
* **HackerRank Coding**: You will face 2 coding questions (approx. 55 mins) focusing on **Arrays, Strings, and basic DSA**. IBM prioritizes code quality and logic over just speed.
* **English Proficiency**: A short MCQ-based test (approx. 10 mins) evaluating grammar, vocabulary, and reading comprehension to ensure you can collaborate with global teams.

### **2. Cognitive Assessment (Gamified Round)**
* **Cognify**: This optional but frequent round uses 5-6 mini-games (e.g., *Gridlock*, *Numbubbles*, *Shortcuts*) to measure your spatial reasoning, problem-solving speed, and numerical ability.

### **3. Technical Deep-Dive**
* **Core CS Fundamentals**: Expect questions on **OOPS, DBMS (Joins/Normalisation), Operating Systems**, and **Networking**. You should be ready to write basic logic (e.g., String reversal or Pattern printing) on a whiteboard or paper.
* **Project Walkthrough**: Be prepared to explain your academic projects using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

### **4. HR & Cultural Fit**
* **IBM Values**: The final round assesses your adaptability, willingness to work in shifts, and long-term career goals. A common question is "Why IBM?"—focus on their leadership in **Hybrid Cloud and AI (Watson)**.
