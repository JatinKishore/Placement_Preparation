## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. Core ECE & Manufacturing Screening**
The first round is a comprehensive assessment (approx. 25 questions) covering:
* **Fundamental Components**: Be thorough with **Rectifiers, Capacitors, Inductors, and Transformers**. Expect to explain **Ohm’s Law** and its application in sensor circuits.
* **Quality & Management**: Understanding **TQM (Total Quality Management)** is critical. You must be able to articulate the "Need for a manufacturing unit" and the specific "Challenges in establishing large manufacturing hubs in India".
* **Role Alignment**: Prepare a strong answer for "Why are you interested in this role?" specifically tailored to Quality Management.
