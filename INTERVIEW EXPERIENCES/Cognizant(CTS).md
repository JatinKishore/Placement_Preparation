## Key Aspects of the Interview Experience

### **1. AI-Driven Communication Assessment**
* **The "Versant" Style**: This is a mandatory 60-minute round focusing on verbal fluency. Sections include **Reading Sentences**, **Repeat Sentences**, **Jumbled Sentences**, and **Storytelling**.
* **Accuracy is Key**: Use a high-quality mic and ensure a quiet background, as the evaluation is primarily done by AI.

### **2. Aptitude & Game-Based Learning**
* **Quantitative Aptitude**: 30 questions focusing on Time & Work, Profit & Loss, and Probability.
* **Game-Based Round**: Instead of standard logical puzzles, you will play 4 games (randomly selected from 24) like **GeoSudo**, **Motion Challenge** (maze solving), and **Switch Challenge**.

### **3. Cluster-Based Technical Assessment**
You must choose a "Skill Cluster" (typically **Cluster 1: Java + Web** or **Cluster 2: Python + Cloud**).
* **SQL**: 2-3 complex queries involving **Joins** and **Aggregate functions**.
* **Coding**: 2 Java programs focused on **String Handling** or **Arrays**.
* **Web UI**: A scenario-based task to implement a small UI component using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
